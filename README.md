### Hi!

I am a researcher and university teacher in study of cultures, educated in study of religion and sociology. Well seasoned in qualitative analysis, I became interested in coding and data-analysis few o years ago, and I have been catching up ever since. 

Currently I am involved in two research projects, where I apply some of these skills:
- [Legitrel]([https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/religion-politics-and-legitimation) studies the legitimation of religion in politics and legitimation of politics with religion. My work within this project focuses on political platforms and textual analysis.
- [Fauna et Flora Fennica](https://sites.utu.fi/faffe/en/) seeks to locate observations of animal and plant species from historical textual data, such as digitized newspapers, and places the observations on maps. I work on code that automates the workflow, e.g. in adding GPS data on basis of location data.

In data-analysis tasks, I mainly work with Python, Pandas, Excel and Google Colab. I took my first steps in coding with Java, and I have basic knowledge of R and SQL, and I also know something about Javascript, HTML and CSS.
